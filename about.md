![me](/images/ab.png)

I am Abhilash Kolanthara. I am passionate about programming, scalable architecture, distributed systems and optimizing just about anything. I blog *mostly* about data structures, algorithms, .net and a bit of mathematics too.
Usually you would find me rambling about tech and FOSS when somebody is listening or pretending to be listening.

If you would like to get in touch, drop me a line at [abkolan@gmail.com](mailto:abkolan+blog@gmail.com).
